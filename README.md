# password_generator
This is a password generator that is created using fastAPI and the secrets module from python to generate a strong password for the user. It has a basic front-end where the user can select the amount of characters they want in their password and display the generated password. The website is deployed using AWS S3 and AWS Lambda. This goal of this project is to apply all steps of web application development, even if it is at a basica level, combining front-end, back-end and deployment.
